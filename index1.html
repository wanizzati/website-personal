<p>Hi. I am Wan Izzati Binti Wan Muzamil. In this site I would probably be talking about the life of me. A little bit about family, where I grew up and stuffs like that. Afterwards I'll share a bit of the things I love. I'm really a nobody, but I'd appreciate it if you would spend some time to read this. Peace & love.</p>

<p>I was born on the 29th of June, 1998 in Shah Alam, Selangor. I lived there for the first 12 years of my life before going into a boarding school in Johor Bharu. Growing up, my parents were always busy being away for work but they managed to stay home and be available for their children on the weekends. My grandparents basically played a big part of raising me and my brothers.</p>

<p>The boarding school that I went to was my mother's alma mater when she was in high school. From then on I've lived in Johor Bharu for all my 5 years of high school while my family back home moved from Shah Alam, Selangor to Nilai, Negeri Sembilan. I could honestly say that I've had a bittersweet relationship with the memories from school. Some part of me never wanted some things in the past to happen but some other parts really wished to go back in time to relive a particular moment. All in all, high school really did shape me as the person I am today.</p>

<p>I am the first and only daughter and I have 3 brothers, and a dad whos embarrassing at times but he's the best nevertheless. Although, at times I really do wish I had a sister because I tend to get lonely as a girl. But at the end of the day, I'm truly grateful for all that I have. I get along with my brothers alright, my father is basically my best friend, and my mother is the toughest woman I know.</p>

<p>I can't think of an answer whenever anyone asks me regarding my hobbies. It's because I'm 22 now and I rarely ever had time to even have hobbies at this age. I only know to elaborate on the things I love and enjoy. I enjoy reading, music and films so much. I tend to do researches upon them whenever I find it deep and meaningful. I feel like the band The Beatles deserves an honorary mention in this site just because they are one of the best musicians I know and I truly appreciate their music so much. </p>
